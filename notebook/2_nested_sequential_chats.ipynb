    "# Solving Complex Tasks with A Sequence of Nested Chats\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how you can leverage **nested chats** to solve complex task with AutoGen. Nested chats is a sequence of chats created by a receiver agent after receiving a message from a sender agent and finished before the receiver agent replies to this message. Nested chats allow AutoGen agents to use other agents as their inner monologue to accomplish tasks. This abstraction is powerful as it allows you to compose agents in rich ways. This notebook shows how you can nest a pretty complex sequence of chats among _inner_ agents inside an _outer_ agent.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Outer Level\n",
    "In the following code block, at the outer level, we have communication between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `user` - `developer` for solving the first task, i.e., `tasks[0]`.\n",
    "- `user` - `snarchitect` for solving the second task, i.e., `tasks[1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inner Level (Nested Chats)\n",
    "Since the first task is quite complicated, we created a sequence of _nested chats_ as the inner monologue of Developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `developer` - `developer_manager`: This chat intends to delegate the task received by developer to the Developer Manager to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `developer` - `developer_commenter`: This chat takes the output from Nested Chat 1, i.e., Developer vs. Developer Manager, and lets the Commenter polish the content to make a nice commented piece of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `developer` - `developer_error_handler`: This chat takes the output from Nested Chat 2 and intends to let the Reviewer agent review the content from Nested Chat 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `developer` - `developer_commenter`: This chat takes the output from previous nested chats and intends to let the Commenter agent finalize the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of nested chats can be realized with the `register_nested_chats` function, which allows one to register one or a sequence of chats to a particular agent (in this example, the `developer` agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Information about the sequence of chats can be specified in the `chat_queue` argument of the `register_nested_chats` function. The following fields are especially useful:\n",
    "- `recipient` (required) specifies the nested agent;\n",
    "- `message` specifies what message to send to the nested recipient agent. In a sequence of nested chats, if the `message` field is not specified, we will use the last message the registering agent received as the initial message in the first chat and will skip any subsequent chat in the queue that does not have the `message` field. You can either provide a string or define a callable that returns a string.\n",
    "- `summary_method` decides what to get out of the nested chat. You can either select from existing options including `\"last_msg\"` and `\"reflection_with_llm\"`, or or define your own way on what to get from the nested chat with a Callable.\n",
    "- `max_turns` determines how many turns of conversation to have between the concerned agent pairs."

      "2. **Robust Initialization and Operation:** Both `Node` and `SkipList` initializations are secured against unforeseen exceptions, ensuring the robust creation of these objects.\n",
      "3. **Lock Management:** The lock is always released in the `finally` block of the `insert_element` method, guaranteeing the release of the lock even if an exception occurs.\n",
      "4. **Error Reporting:** Error messages are printed to `stderr`, preserving standard output for regular program output and making it easier to identify and debug errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "This enhanced implementation provides a more resilient concurrent skip list structure, prepared to handle unexpected situations gracefully and maintain stable operation even under error conditions.\n",

Use of `typing` module: To make your code more readable and maintainable, consider using the `typing` module in Python to provide type hints for all function arguments, return types, and class properties. This will help other developers understand the expected input types and avoid any potential type errors. For example, you can use the `typing.List` type hint for the `keys` parameter of your `insertion_sort` function to indicate that it should be a list of integers.\n",
      "2. Function signature documentation: To provide a concise and easy-to-understand overview of each function's signature, consider adding function signature documentation using the `signature` decorator from the `sigil` library. This will include input and output types, as well as any constraints or requirements. For example, you can use the `signature` decorator to document the `insertion_sort` function signature, including the `keys` parameter of type `typing.List[int]`.\n",

Using a modular design pattern where each module contains a single responsibility, and the dependencies between modules are well-defined will make the code easier to understand and modify in the future. For example, you can create a `utils` module for utility functions, a `skiplist` module for the skip list implementation, and a `tests` module for test cases.\n",

Use of constants and immutable data structures: To ensure that input values are not modified during function execution, consider using constant objects and immutable data structures (e.g., `collections.abc.Hashable`) throughout your code.

      "\n",
      "1. Use of `typing` module: To make your code more readable and maintainable, consider using the `typing` module in Python to provide type hints for all function arguments, return types, and class properties. This will help other developers understand the expected input types and avoid potential type errors. For example, you can use the `typing.List` type hint for the `keys` parameter of your `insertion_sort` function to indicate that it should be a list of integers.\n",
      "2. Function signature documentation: To provide a concise and easy-to-understand overview of each function's signature, consider adding function signature documentation using the `signature` decorator from the `sigil` library. This will include input and output types, as well as any constraints or requirements. For example, you can use the `signature` decorator to document the `insertion_sort` function signature, including the `keys` parameter of type `typing.List[int]`.\n",

      "4. Code organization and structure: To make your code easier to maintain and update, consider organizing it into separate modules or classes. Using a modular design pattern where each module contains a single responsibility, and the dependencies between modules are well-defined will make the code easier to understand and modify in the future. For example, you can create a `utils` module for utility functions, a `skiplist` module for the skip list implementation, and a `tests` module for test cases.\n",

For example, you can use the `typing.List` type hint for the `keys` parameter of your `insertion_sort` function to indicate that it should be a list of integers.\n",
      "2. Function signature documentation: To provide a concise and easy-to-understand overview of each function's signature, consider adding function signature documentation using the `signature` decorator from the `sigil` library. This will include input and output types, as well as any constraints or requirements. For example, you can use the `signature` decorator to document the `insertion_sort` function signature, including the `keys` parameter of type `typing.List[int]`.\n",
      "3. Code optimization: To improve the performance of your skip list algorithm, consider optimizing the code for better performance by using techniques such as loop unrolling, Memoization, or cache optimization. You can use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in the code and then apply optimization techniques accordingly. For example, you can use loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations in your `insertion_sort` function, which can help improve performance for large datasets.\n",
      "4. Code organization and structure: To make your code easier to maintain and update, consider organizing it into separate modules or classes. Using a modular design pattern where each module contains a single responsibility, and the dependencies between modules are well-defined will make the code easier to understand and modify in the future. For example, you can create a `utils` module for utility functions, a `skiplist` module for the skip list implementation, and a `tests` module for test cases.\n",
      "5. Use of constants and immutable data structures: To ensure that input values are not modified during function execution, consider using constant objects and immutable data structures (e.g., `collections.abc.Hashable`) throughout your code. This will help prevent unexpected behavior and make the code more reliable. For example, you can use a constant object to represent the skip list's hash function, which ensures that the hash value is not modified during execution.\n",
      "6. Consider using a logging framework: To keep track of important events and errors that occur during the execution of your skip list algorithm, consider using a logging framework such as `logging` from the Python standard library. This will provide a structured way to log events, errors, and other important information, making it easier to debug and maintain the code in the future. For example, you can use `logging.info` to log informational messages during execution, and `logging.error` to log errors or unexpected behavior.\n",
      "7. Use of a task queue: If your skip list algorithm is intended for use in a larger application or system, consider using a task queue (e.g., `celery` or `apscheduler`) to manage the execution of the algorithm as a separate process or thread. This can help prevent bottlenecks and improve the overall performance of the larger application. For example, you can use a task queue to execute the `insertion_sort` function in parallel with other tasks, which can help improve the performance of the larger application.\n",
      "8. Documentation and testing: To ensure that your skip list algorithm is reliable and well-tested, consider documenting the code thoroughly using tools such as `pydanny` or `Sphinx`. Additionally, write comprehensive test cases to verify that the algorithm functions correctly under a wide range of input values and conditions. For example, you can use `unittest` to write test cases for each function in your `skiplist` module, including the `insertion_sort` function. By implementing these additional suggestions, you can further improve the readability, maintainability, and performance of your skip list algorithm!\n",

      "1. Use `typing` module for type hints: To make the code more readable and maintainable, consider using the `typing` module in Python to provide type hints for all function arguments, return types, and class properties. This will help other developers understand the expected input types and avoid potential type errors.\n",
      "2. Document function signatures with `sigil`: To provide a concise and easy-to-understand overview of each function's signature, consider adding function signature documentation using the `sigil` decorator from the `sigil` library. This will include input and output types, as well as any constraints or requirements.\n",
      "3. Optimize code for performance: To improve the performance of the skip list algorithm, consider optimizing the code for better performance by using techniques such as loop unrolling, memoization, or cache optimization. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in the code and apply optimization techniques accordingly.\n",
      "4. Organize code into separate modules: To make the code easier to maintain and update, consider organizing it into separate modules for different responsibilities. This will make the code easier to understand and modify in the future. For example, create a `utils` module for utility functions, a `skiplist` module for the skip list implementation, and a `tests` module for test cases.\n",
      "5. Use constant objects and immutable data structures: To ensure that input values are not modified during function execution, consider using constant objects and immutable data structures throughout the code. This will help prevent unexpected behavior and make the code more reliable. For example, use a constant object to represent the skip list's hash function to ensure that the hash value is not modified during execution.\n",
      "6. Use a logging framework for event logging: To keep track of important events and errors that occur during the execution of the skip list algorithm, consider using a logging framework such as `logging` from the Python standard library. This will provide a structured way to log events, errors, and other important information, making it easier to debug and maintain the code in the future.\n",
      "7. Use a task queue for parallel execution: If the skip list algorithm is intended for use in a larger application or system, consider using a task queue (e.g., `celery` or `apscheduler`) to manage the execution of the algorithm as a separate process or thread. This can help prevent bottlenecks and improve overall performance.\n",
      "8. Document and test the code thoroughly: To ensure that the skip list algorithm is reliable and well-tested, consider documenting the code thoroughly using tools such as `pydanny` or `Sphinx`. Additionally, write comprehensive test cases to verify that the algorithm functions correctly under a wide range of input values and conditions. By implementing these suggestions, you can further improve the readability, maintainability, and performance of your skip list implementation in Python.\n",

      "2. Document function signatures with `sigil`: To provide a concise and easy-to-understand overview of each function's signature, consider adding function signature documentation using the `sigil` decorator from the `sigil` library. This will include input and output types, as well as any constraints or requirements.\n",
      "3. Optimize code for performance: To improve the performance of the skip list algorithm, consider optimizing the code for better performance by using techniques such as loop unrolling, memoization, or cache optimization. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in the code and apply optimization techniques accordingly.\n",
      "4. Organize code into separate modules: To make the code easier to maintain and update, consider organizing it into separate modules for different responsibilities. This will make the code easier to understand and modify in the future. For example, create a `utils` module for utility functions, a `skiplist` module for the skip list implementation, and a `tests` module for test cases.\n",

Use a logging framework for event logging: To keep track of important events and errors that occur during the execution of the skip list algorithm, consider using a logging framework such as `logging` from the Python standard library. This will provide a structured way to log events, errors, and other important information, making it easier to debug and maintain the code in the future.\n",
      "7. Use a task queue for parallel execution: If the skip list algorithm is intended for use in a larger application or system, consider using a task queue (e.g., `celery` or `apscheduler`) to manage the execution of the algorithm as a separate process or thread. This can help prevent bottlenecks and improve overall performance.\n",
      "8. Document and test the code thoroughly: To ensure that the skip list algorithm is reliable and well-tested, consider documenting the code thoroughly using tools such as `pydanny` or `Sphinx`. Additionally, write comprehensive test cases to verify that the algorithm functions correctly under a wide range of input values and conditions. By implementing these suggestions, you can further improve the readability, maintainability, and performance of your skip list implementation in Python.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Use `typing` module for type hints: To make the code more readable and maintainable, consider using the `typing` module in Python to provide type hints for all function arguments, return types, and class properties. This will help other developers understand the expected input types and avoid potential type errors.\n",
      "2. Document function signatures with `sigil`: To provide a concise and easy-to-understand overview of each function's signature, consider adding function signature documentation using the `sigil` decorator from the `sigil` library. This will include input and output types, as well as any constraints or requirements.\n",
      "3. Optimize code for performance: To improve the performance of the skip list algorithm, consider optimizing the code for better performance by using techniques such as loop unrolling, memoization, or cache optimization. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in the code and apply optimization techniques accordingly.\n",
      "4. Organize code into separate modules: To make the code easier to maintain and update, consider organizing it into separate modules for different responsibilities. This will make the code easier to understand and modify in the future. For example, create a `utils` module for utility functions, a `skiplist` module for the skip list implementation, and a `tests` module for test cases.\n",
      "5. Use constant objects and immutable data structures: To ensure that input values are not modified during function execution, consider using constant objects and immutable data structures throughout the code. This will help prevent unexpected behavior and make the code more reliable. For example, use a constant object to represent the skip list's hash function to ensure that the hash value is not modified during execution.\n",
      "6. Use a logging framework for event logging: To keep track of important events and errors that occur during the execution of the skip list algorithm, consider using a logging framework such as `logging` from the Python standard library. This will provide a structured way to log events, errors, and other important information, making it easier to debug and maintain the code in the future.\n",
      "7. Use a task queue for parallel execution: If the skip list algorithm is intended for use in a larger application or system, consider using a task queue (e.g., `celery` or `apscheduler`) to manage the execution of the algorithm as a separate process or thread. This can help prevent bottlenecks and improve overall performance.\n",
      "8. Document and test the code thoroughly: To ensure that the skip list algorithm is reliable and well-tested, consider documenting the code thoroughly using tools such as `pydanny` or `Sphinx`. Additionally, write comprehensive test cases to verify that the algorithm functions correctly under a wide range of input values and conditions. By implementing these suggestions, you can further improve the readability, maintainability, and performance of your skip list implementation in Python.\n",

      "It looks like you're providing a list of potential improvements for a skip list implementation in Python. Here are some possible ways to address each point:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use `typing` module for type hints:\n",
      "\t* Consider using the `typing` module in Python to provide type hints for all function arguments, return types, and class properties. This will help other developers understand the expected input types and avoid potential type errors.\n",
      "\t* For example, you can use the `@typechecked` decorator from the `typing` module to mark functions and classes with type hints.\n",
      "2. Document function signatures with `sigil`:\n",
      "\t* To provide a concise and easy-to-understand overview of each function's signature, consider adding function signature documentation using the `sigil` decorator from the `sigil` library. This will include input and output types, as well as any constraints or requirements.\n",
      "\t* For example, you can use the `@sigil` decorator to document function signatures in a structured way.\n",
      "3. Optimize code for performance:\n",
      "\t* To optimize the code for better performance, consider using techniques such as loop unrolling, memoization, or cache optimization. These can help improve the execution time of the algorithm.\n",
      "\t* For example, you can use the `functools.lru_cache` decorator to create a cache that stores the results of expensive function calls, reducing the number of times the functions are called.\n",
      "4. Organize code into separate modules:\n",
      "\t* To make the code easier to maintain and update, consider organizing it into separate modules for different responsibilities. For example, create a `utils` module for utility functions, a `skiplist` module for the skip list implementation, and a `tests` module for test cases.\n",
      "\t* For example, you can use the `pydanny` library to generate documentation and automate testing for your code.\n",
      "5. Use constant objects and immutable data structures:\n",
      "\t* To ensure that input values are not modified during function execution, consider using constant objects and immutable data structures throughout the code. This will help prevent unexpected behavior and make the code more reliable.\n",
      "\t* For example, you can use the `typing` module to create constant objects for function arguments and return types, and use immutable data structures such as `numpy.array` or `pandas.Series` to store input values that cannot be modified.\n",
      "6. Use a logging framework for event logging:\n",
      "\t* To keep track of important events and errors that occur during the execution of the skip list algorithm, consider using a logging framework such as `logging` from the Python standard library. This will provide a structured way to log events, errors, and other important information, making it easier to debug and maintain the code in the future.\n",
      "\t* For example, you can use the `logging` module to create a logger instance and configure it to log at different levels (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, etc.) depending on the importance of the event or error.\n",
      "7. Use a task queue for parallel execution:\n",
      "\t* If the skip list algorithm is intended for use in a larger application or system, consider using a task queue (e.g., `celery` or `apscheduler`) to manage the execution of the algorithm as a separate process or thread. This can help prevent bottlenecks and improve overall performance.\n",
      "\t* For example, you can use the `celery` library to create a Celery worker that schedules tasks for parallel execution, or use the `apscheduler` library to schedule tasks for execution in a background thread pool.\n",
      "8. Document and test the code thoroughly:\n",
      "\t* To ensure that the skip list algorithm is reliable and well-tested, consider documenting the code thoroughly using tools such as `pydanny` or `Sphinx`. Additionally, write comprehensive test cases to verify that the algorithm functions correctly under a wide range of input values and conditions.\n",
      "\t* For example, you can use the `unittest` module to write unit tests for your code, or use the `behave` library to write acceptance tests that validate the behavior of your code in different scenarios. By implementing these suggestions, you can further improve the readability, maintainability, and performance of your skip list implementation in Python.\n",
